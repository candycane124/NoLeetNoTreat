# NoLeetNoTreat

# Inspiration:
Impulse buying has become a common problem in the digital age, with users often making purchases they later regret. We wanted to create a solution that merges productivity with responsible shopping, leveraging coding challenges to give users a pause before they make unnecessary purchases. Inspired by the growing community of developers using LeetCode and the need for mindfulness in online spending, NoLeetNoTreat was born.


# What it does:
NoLeetNoTreat is a Chrome extension that intercepts users trying to make impulsive online purchases. Before they can proceed to checkout, they must complete a LeetCode problem. This forces users to pause, think critically, and reconsider their purchase. Not only does it encourage better financial habits, but it also sharpens their coding skills along the way

# See it in action:

Create a Google Chrome Extension by uploading this code. 

Click on the Google Chrome Extension to hook-up your LeetCode account. 

Go to some product (you've been meaning to buy) on Amazon and wait a few seconds for the page to fully load. 

Attempt to click "Add item to cart" only for your impulsive plan to be foiled!

You must now solve a LeetCode question before you can buy your item!

Otherwise, No Leet No Treat!
