# NoLeetNoTreat

# Inspiration:
Do you ever think about how much junk you have cluttered or never wear? Have you been avoiding your LeetCode practice as of late? Look no further, NoLeetNoTreat tackles the challenges towards sustainability and entry into tech (especially as a women)!

Impulse buying has become a common problem in the digital age, with users often making purchases they later regret.
We wanted to create a solution that merges productivity with responsible shopping, leveraging coding challenges to give users a pause before they make unnecessary purchases.
Inspired by the growing community of developers using LeetCode and the need for mindfulness in online spending, NoLeetNoTreat was born.


# What it does:
NoLeetNoTreat is a Google Chrome extension that intercepts users trying to make impulsive online purchases.
Before they can proceed to checkout, they must complete a LeetCode problem. This forces users to pause, think critically, and reconsider their purchase. Not only does it encourage better financial habits, but it also sharpens their coding skills along the way!
